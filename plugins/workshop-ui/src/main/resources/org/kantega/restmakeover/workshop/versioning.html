<p>
    Providing your service over an API is very different from providing your service as web pages. If you change the protocol of your
    service, even just a little bit, your clients code are going to break.
</p>
<p>
    You will have to provide old versions of your service when you upgrade your API. You cannot expect your clients to
    assemble an IT project and upgrade their code just because you decide that you want to introduce a new concept in
    your API. A concept that they may not even need or want.
</p>
<p>
    The most sensible way to achieve backwards compatibility with existing clients is to have a very distinct separation
    between your API code and the implementation of the business logic.
</p>
<p>
    A good approach is to have a version number as a part of the url. When you have to upgrade your API, just create a new
    end point with a new version number for the upgraded version. Let both your old version and the new version call
    the same business logic.
</p>

<p>
    The last task is to create a new version of your API where your don't identify blog posts by their title, but by a
    unique, persistent id. You will have to make a new end-point with the version number as part of the URL. The old
    API should still work so that you don't break existing clients.
